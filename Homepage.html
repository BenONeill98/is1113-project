              <p id="intro">Hi my name is Ben O'Neill and I am a BIS 1 student. This is my project for my IS 1113 module. I created this HTML with the help of implementing CSS and using bootstrap.
                 In this website you will be able to view such things as my Curriculum Vitae, my Interests and my EBus. I enjoyed creating this project very much, I relished the challenge that was involved with this task and feel like I tackled it to the best of my ability.</p>
